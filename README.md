# Space Data Network

A Peer-to-Peer Network for Collaborative Space Data Exchange, based on [LibP2P](https://libp2p.io) and utilizing [Google Flatbuffers](https://flatbuffers.dev/) through schemas maintained at the [Space Data Standards](https://spacedatastandards.org) project.

## Environment Variables

The application can be configured using the following environment variables:

- `SPACE_DATA_NETWORK_DATASTORE_PASSWORD`: Used to access the application's keystore. This is a critical security parameter, and it's recommended to set this in production environments. If not set, the application will use a default password, which is not recommended for production use.

- `SPACE_DATA_NETWORK_DATASTORE_DIRECTORY`: Specifies the filesystem path for the secure LevelDB storage for the node's keystore. If not explicitly set via this environment variable, the application defaults to using a directory named .spacedatanetwork located in the user's home directory (e.g., ~/.spacedatanetwork). This path is critical for ensuring that the node's keystore is stored securely and persistently, and it's advisable to set this path in production environments to a secure, backed-up location.

- `SPACE_DATA_NETWORK_WEBSERVER_PORT`: Port for the webserver to listen on.

- `SPACE_DATA_NETWORK_CPUS`: Number of CPUs to give to the webserver

- `SPACE_DATA_NETWORK_ETHEREUM_DERIVATION_PATH`: BIP32 / BIP44 path to use for account.  Defaults to: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`.  

### Setting Environment Variables

#### For Development

Environment variables can be set in various ways depending on your operating environment.

##### Using a `.env` File

For development purposes, you might set them in a `.env` file with tools like `dotenv`.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following line:

```env
SPACE_DATA_NETWORK_DATASTORE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

Replace `your_secure_password` with your actual keystore password.

##### Setting Variables in the Shell

In Unix-based systems, you can export the environment variable in your shell before running the application:

```bash
export SPACE_DATA_NETWORK_DATASTORE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

In Windows Command Prompt, you can set the environment variable like this:

```cmd
set KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

#### For Docker

When running your application in a Docker container, you can pass environment variables using the `-e` or `--env` flag with the `docker run` command.

```bash
docker run -e SPACE_DATA_NETWORK_DATASTORE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password your_docker_image_name
```

Alternatively, you can use an `env_file` in your `docker-compose.yml` if you're using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  your_service_name:
    image: your_docker_image_name
    env_file:
      - .env
```

Ensure the `.env` file is in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` or specify the correct path to it.

> **Note**: Ensure that you never expose sensitive environment variables like `SPACE_DATA_NETWORK_DATASTORE_PASSWORD` in public code repositories, Docker images, or shared documents. Always keep such information secure.
